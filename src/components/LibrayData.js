      "Alexander and Sadikus fifth edition of Fundamentals of Electric Circuits continues in the spirit of its successful previous editions, with the objective of presenting circuit analysis in a manner that is clearer, more interesting, and easier to understand than other, more traditional texts. Students are introduced to the sound, six-step problem solving methodology in chapter one, and are consistently made to apply and practice these steps in practice problems and homework problems throughout the text. A balance of theory, worked examples and extended examples, practice problems, and real-world applications, combined with over 468 new or changed homework problems for the fifth edition and robust media offerings, renders the fifth edition the most comprehensive and student-friendly approach to linear circuit analysis. This edition retains the Design a Problem feature which helps students develop their design skills by having the student develop the question as well as the solution. There are over 100 Design a Problem exercises integrated into the problem sets in the book.",

      "One of the most important key technologies for digital communication systems as well as storage media is coding theory. It provides a means to transmit information across time and space over noisy and unreliable communication channels. Coding Theory: Algorithms, Architectures and Applications provides a concise overview of channel coding theory and practice, as well as the accompanying signal processing architectures. The book is unique in presenting algorithms, architectures, and applications of coding theory in a unified framework. It covers the basics of coding theory before moving on to discuss algebraic linear block and cyclic codes, turbo codes and low density parity check codes and space-time codes. Coding Theory provides algorithms and architectures used for implementing coding and decoding strategies as well as coding schemes used in practice especially in communication systems.",

Lakhani show how reinventing the firm around data, analytics, and AI removes traditional constraints on scale, scope, and learning that have restricted business growth for hundreds of years. From Airbnb to Ant Financial, Microsoft to Amazon, research shows how AI-driven processes are vastly more scalable than traditional processes, allow massive scope increase, enabling companies to straddle industry boundaries, and create powerful opportunities for learning--to drive ever more accurate, complex, and sophisticated predictions.When traditional operating constraints are removed, strategy becomes a whole new game, one whose rules and likely outcomes this book will make clear.
